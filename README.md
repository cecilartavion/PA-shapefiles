# state-shapefiles

## State Election Shapefiles
This is a repository of state VTDs and precincts (where available) joined with election results and congressional plans for the 115th Congress.

### What’s inside
In the root directory you’ll find a folder for each state we have processed data for. The folders will be named by the two letter postal code for that state. We will continue to add states as we process more shapefiles and election results.

Within each state’s directory you’ll find:
* The six files associated with a shapefile of VTDs (.cpg, .dbf, .prj, .qpj, .shp, .shx)
* A README.md for the subdirectory describing processing methods and metadata <br />


And when available:
* A shapefile of voting precincts with election results and congressional plans
